# Perceptrons Explained

This is an introduction to several variants of the perceptron algorithm, with interactive models you can run in your browser.

To build locally, use webpack to bundle all the files in `src/`, which generates `dist/main.js`.

`Perceptron_Tests.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook with Python versions of both the Maxover and the Voted Perceptron models.
