# Perceptrons Explained

This is an introduction to several variants of the perceptron algorithm, with interactive models you can run in your browser.

To build locally, use webpack to bundle all the files in `src/` (entry point is `index.js`), which generates `dist/main.js`.

Also uses jQuery, d3, and Google Fonts for Muli.

`Perceptron_Tests.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook with Python versions of all three perceptron models: the original one, the Maxover and the Voted Perceptron. It also features visualizations in matplotlib.
